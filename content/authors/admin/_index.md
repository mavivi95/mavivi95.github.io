I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Engineering at Universidad de los Andes (Colombia) focusing on multi-agent AI systems and cooperative resilience property. I began this program in 2023, supported by a competitive scholarship (awarded by Google DeepMind). I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Applied Mathematics, which I completed in 2022. My thesis centered on neural networks and theoretical approaches to mitigating overfitting, combining mathematical principles with practical AI applications. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering in 2018, where I developed a strong foundation in systems design, programming, and signal processing.
