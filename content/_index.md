        My research focuses on understanding and designing resilient multi-agent systems, particularly mixed-motive settings such as social dilemmas. I use inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)â€”with an emphasis on preference-based reward inferenceâ€”to reveal latent social objectives and leverage the notion of cooperative resilience to guide reward learning that sustains collaboration under disruption (e.g., resource scarcity, failures, and strategic/adversarial behavior). The goal is to develop agents that adapt, maintain performance and fairness, and thrive despite shocks and non-stationarityâ€”ultimately aligning individual incentives with collective well-being and long-term stability.
