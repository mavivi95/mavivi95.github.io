üåç A week of cooperation, learning, and shared curiosity

This summer, I had the opportunity to attend the Cooperative AI Summer School 2025, organized by the Cooperative AI Foundation
.
It took place in Marlow, UK ‚Äî a quiet town surrounded by green landscapes, perfect for a week dedicated to deep discussions about AI, cooperation, and human values.

üí° Main themes that inspired me

The school brought together researchers from diverse fields ‚Äî from machine learning and game theory to philosophy and social science ‚Äî all focused on a shared question:
How can we build AI systems that cooperate effectively with humans and with each other?

Some talks explored the formal foundations of cooperation and mixed-motive games, while others focused on the social and ethical dimensions of AI. I was particularly inspired by sessions on emergent coordination, multi-agent learning under uncertainty, and resilient collective behaviors.

ü§ù Connecting research and purpose

Beyond the technical depth, what struck me most was the sense of community.
I met researchers and practitioners working on inverse reinforcement learning, value alignment, and collective decision-making, many of whom share a vision close to my own research on cooperative resilience in AI systems.

The school encouraged an open, reflective atmosphere ‚Äî blending academic rigor with philosophical curiosity, something rare and deeply motivating.

üå± Looking forward

I returned from Marlow with new perspectives, collaborations, and a reinforced belief that cooperation is not just an emergent property, but a design principle for the AI systems of the future.
As I continue my doctoral research, I hope to integrate these insights into frameworks that help agents adapt, sustain fairness, and thrive together under disruption.
